Welcome to the Tire GitHub page! Here is the source code of the programming language tire.

## Runing
To run the cli, just install [Python](https://www.python.org/).
Then open cmd in the source code's directory and type in: python main.py.

If you don't want to open the CLI, then type in python main.py (file you want to open)

Then to run a file with the CLI, type in run (file name)
Then learn how to use [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTWzKk6QMMg)

# Conclusion
Well, thanks for reading, hope you have fun with my language!

One key note, this language isn't mature at all. (there will probably be lots of bugs).
So don't use this in major projects.
